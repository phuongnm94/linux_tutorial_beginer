1. Down and install vscode [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Install - Remote Development [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) ![ig](./img/dev-env.png)
   >Note: it will automatically install `Remote - SSH` plugins. If not, you should install `Remote - SSH` 

### 2. Request to Jaist computing server. 
1. Login to the login node via `ssh s2010235@spcc`
2. Open a new screen session `screen -S test_vscode`
3. Request a computing server `qsub -q SINGLE -I`
4. Note the computing server host id (e.g. `spcc-138`). 
5. Detach out of screen (`Ctrl-A + d`).

### 3. Remote Server Configs 

1. Open SSH remote config file (path: `~/.ssh/config` in your local computer, similar to document `0.linux_cmds.pdf` ):

    You can use `Ctrl + P` (or `Command + P` in MacOS) and type `>remote` and select `Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File...` ![config](./img/remote-ssh.png)
    > Note: this file save information of your remote servers. See more the format of this file in [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ssh_config.5.html)


2. Fill to this file the server information and saved if **the server information have not exist in your file**:
   ```
    Host remote_host_name_
        HostName remote_host_name_address 
    ```
    examples: 
    ```yaml
    Host spcc-138
        HostName spcc-138
    ```  

### 3. Open Computing Server in VScode
