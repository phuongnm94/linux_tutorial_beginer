### Conda environment  


### Why conda?
- Each project, we should create a special environment containing all packages related to that project. 
- The env should be independented to reduce the bad affect between projects. 
- Conda is the tool to manage (add, remove, install...) the environment.

### Python environment
- Python environment contains 2 important information: 
    - python version: e.g. python 2.7 (old), python 3.7 (recommended),  python 3.8 or higher, etc.
    - packages: e.g. torch==1.7, numpy, pandas, sklearn, etc.

### Install conda: 
- Miniconda [(link-file-install)](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh) is recommended.   All other miniconda for  various systems can be found in https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
    > You dont need to install again because your user already is installed on jaist   server. Checking conda by this command: 
    ```bash 
    conda --help
    ``` 
    output 
    ```
    usage: conda [-h] [-V] command ...
    conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.
    ....
    ```
### Use conda 
- Check more the command of conda in [here (official)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) or  [here (briefly)](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/deployment/conda-create-environment-and-everything-you-need-to-know-to-manage-conda-virtual-environment/). 
    Some important commands: 

    - create new environment: e.g. `conda create --name test_name python=3.7`
    - activate env : e.g. `conda activate test_name`
    - install package of env : e.g. active env, and `pip install sklearn`
    - install packages via file `requirements.txt`: e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt` where the content of requirements.txt contains all the packages with its version if necessary: 
        - example content: 
            ```text
            sklearn
            numpy==1.23.3
            ```
    - check one package is installed in that env or not : e.g. active env, and check the package sklearn by: `pip list | grep sklearn`, if the result show a sklearn and version related, it is sucessful installed.
    - deactivate env : e.g. `conda deactivate`
    - delete env : e.g. `conda  env remove -n test_name`


###         <span style="color:red">**Exercise**:</span>
Create the environment name `test_abc`  using `python 3.6` and install the packages  `pandas`, `sklearn`,  and "X". Run the program python `example.py` in your environment in the terminal by `python example.py` (X is the hidden package, which you will in the error, which you need figure out what the package you need to install).
