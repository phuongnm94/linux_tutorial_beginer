## Useful linux programs
- `man` show up documents of a program in Linux. All programs in Linux system are attached detail documents. E.g. `man ls` will show all documents of program `ls`. 
    - output of `man ls`:
        ```command
        LS(1)   User Commands      LS(1)

        NAME
            ls - list directory contents

        SYNOPSIS
            ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
 
        Manual page ls(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)
        ```
        <span style="color:red">**Exercise**:</span> use `man` to find which option of `ls` program show the _list of files in current directory sorted by modification time, newest first_? 

        Normal output of `ls`:
        ```
         0.linux_cmds.MD   1.jaist_server_remote.MD   2.conda_env.MD   2.conda_env.pdf   example.py
        ```

        Normal output of `ls` with option `-a`, which is show all the hidden files or folders, output of command `ls -a`:
        ```
         .   ..   0.linux_cmds.MD   1.jaist_server_remote.MD   2.conda_env.MD   2.conda_env.pdf   example.py
        ```
        where `.` is  current directory, `..` is the parent directory. 
        You need to find which options (use `man`, NOT use **google**) that make output of `ls` program like bellow (output is listed with many columns, and the modification time is sorted):
        ```bash  
        total 386
        -rw------- 1 s1920413 student   1475 Sep 13 00:20  0.linux_cmds.MD
        -rw------- 1 s1920413 student  45551 Sep 12 22:15  2.conda_env.pdf
        -rw------- 1 s1920413 student   2659 Sep 12 22:11  2.conda_env.MD
        -rw------- 1 s1920413 student    206 Sep 12 22:08  example.py
        ```

- `cat file_name/file_path`: show content of file `file_name` or `file_path`
- `code file_name/file_path`: show content of  `file_name` or `file_path`, and edit file with vscode.
    > **Note**: this command only run on your local computer (macos / linux), can not run on server, because server have no GUI (Graphical User Interface). 
- `git`: check [this link](./4.git_code_manager.MD). 
- `ssh` remote program (see more documents of this program by `man ssh`). Linux system (or server) can be remoted by this program if that system already installed _ssh server service_ (JAIST server  installed this service) and you have account in there. 
    ```command
    # template 
    ssh <account_id>@<server_host_or_ip> 

    # example with JAIST server 
    ssh s2010235@spcc.jaist.ac.jp
    ```

    - For security, you can login to server via type your password every time.  However, another way using remote key (usually saved in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (private key), `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (public key)) is more convinient (no need to type password every time, remote key can be used to identify person in many kind of other services such as _github.com_). In this way, you make a contrast with server that, any person have your remote key, can access to your account.  
    - Check your key is generated or not? 
        ><span style="color:red">**Practice:**</span> Use `ls ~/.ssh/` to see this folder contains `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` or not. 

    - For generating your new key, you can use follow command, but pls **read the note first**:
        > **Warning:** if your new key is generated again and override on old key, all the current remote services and servers (including JAIST servers) can NOT remote until you copy the new key to server again.  

        cmd generate your key `ssh-keygen -t rsa`. => enter your path (or agree with the default path) => enter the passphrase, which is password to use your key.
    - **SSH config file:**  is the file save your **setting** when remote to servers or to online services. This file is saved in `~/.ssh/config` on your **local computer (macbook pro)**, NOT on server.  The content of this file follows the format of `yaml` (see more in [here](https://docs.fileformat.com/programming/yaml/)), which one kind of data structure format (similar to `json`, or `xml`).
        ><span style="color:red">**Practice:**</span> Use `cat ~/.ssh/config` to see the content of your ssh config file.

        basic config you need to know  (full docs in [here](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config)): 
        ```yaml 
        # ====================================
        Host spcc-* # this line config all the "remote name" matching pattern "spcc-*". Specifies the real host name to log into. This can be used to specify nicknames or abbreviations for hosts.  
            IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # config refer to path of access key for the remoting name pattern "spcc-*"
            User s2010235               # config refer to user_name for the remoting name  pattern "spcc-*"

        # ====================================
        Host test_funny_funny # remember that this can be used to specify nicknames or abbreviations for hosts. Any kind of name is ok. 
            HostName spcc-a40g01 # address of server (it can be IPv4 address, 250.125.29.xx)
            User s1920413

        Host spcc-064   # host name, because this host-name matching pattern "spcc-*", this host name extend all the setting of "spcc-*"
            HostName spcc-064.jaist.ac.jp

        Host spcc-a40g01
            HostName spcc-a40g01 
        ```
        For example, you need to use this command `ssh s2010235@spcc-064.jaist.ac.jp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa`, when you want to remote to `spcc-064.jaist.ac.jp` server with user name  `s2010235` and use the access key `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. However, by the above `~/.ssh/config` file, you just need type `ssh spcc-064`, ssh program will collect all the setting _user-name, access key, host address_ in the config file to remote to server.
        
        ><span style="color:red">**Exercise:**</span> Answer and do following questions: <br/>
        [1]. With above config file, what is the **setting** (username, access keyfile, host-address) when you use this command `ssh test_funny_funny`.<br/>
        [2]. Type `code ~/.ssh/config`  to see the content and edit  your ssh config file. Add to your config file a remote name `test_bolo_bala` with the **settings** equal to the command `ssh s2010235@lmpcc.jaist.ac.jp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa`. The successful output can check by run this command `ssh test_bolo_bala`, and you can access to the `lmpcc` JAIST server (following output).

        ```command 
        ~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~
            Welcome to Large Memory PC Cluster, lmpcc !
        Notice:
            Sample files are available in /Samples folder.
        ~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~+~~
        [s2010235@lmpcc ~ ] 
        ```
- Bash shell 
    
    - **if-then**: Create a bash file `test_ifthen.sh` with following content (using `code test_ifthen.sh` to open new file and paste the below content and save it), and run it with the command: `bash  test_ifthen.sh`

        ```bash 
        #!/bin/bash
        name=John
        if [ $name = "John" ]
        then
            echo "John is here !!!"
        fi
        ``` 
    - **if-then-else**:   
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash 
        num=150
        if [ $num -gt 100 ] && [ $num -lt 200 ]
        then
            echo "The number lies between 100 and 200"
        fi
            echo "The number doesnt lies between 100 and 200"
        fi
        ```
    - **for loop**:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        for i in 1 2 3 4 5
        do
            echo "Welcome $i times"
        done
        ```
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        for i in {1..5}
        do
            echo "Welcome $i times"
        done
        ```

- other useful commands:
    - `vim file_name`: edit content of `file_name` on terminal, if `file_name` is not exist, new file will be created  (type `esc`, `:`, `q`, `!` if you want to exit `vim`).
    - `which <program_name>`: show the path of your program, e.g. `which ls` will show path of `ls` program `/usr/bin/ls`.
    - `tail -n 10 file_name`: show the tail 10 line of `file_name`
    - `head -n 10 file_name`: show the head 10 line of `file_name` 
    - `grep`: filter with matching condition. E.g. You want to find line containing word `'abc'` in 10 lines tail of file. `tail -n 10 file_name | grep abc` 
    - `nvidia-smi`: show GPU usage, only run on server containing GPU.
